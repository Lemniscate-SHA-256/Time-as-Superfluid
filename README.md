# Time-as-Superfluid
Superfluidity is a state of matter that allows a fluid to flow without friction. By applying this concept to time, I propose a radical hypothesis: time could be a superfluid dimension. This theory, still largely speculative, aims to unify certain aspects of general relativity and quantum mechanics using analogies with quantum fluids.

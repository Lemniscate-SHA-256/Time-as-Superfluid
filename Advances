+ First we will cover superfluidity
+ I think that time is an illusion, a result of the friction of one or more other n-dimensions. (We will explicit dimensions futher and take intuitive out-the box steps, let imagination runs wild for a time, you know, i'm mad)
+ Time doesn't exist in itself, it is a dependent variable (here I will base my idea on mathematical logic, lambda calculus and a formal system) (For fun !)
+ I will make my theory explicit on the basis of the Big Bounce.

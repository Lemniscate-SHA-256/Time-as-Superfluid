To explain superfluidity using GNU Octave and visualizations, we need to address some fundamental concepts of fluid physics and quantum properties. 
Superfluidity is a state of matter in which a fluid can flow without viscosity. 
This phenomenon is observed in certain liquids at very low temperatures, such as helium-4.

Basic concepts of Superfluidity

Bose-Einstein state: At very low temperatures, the atoms of certain isotopes, such as helium-4, condense in the same quantum state, forming a Bose-Einstein condensate.

Viscosity-free: In this state, the fluid can flow without friction.

Quantum flow: The motion of the superfluid is quantized, i.e. it has discrete rather than continuous characteristics.
